			<li>Self-made: Their producer, Woozi, is also the leader of the Vocal unit, and they <mark>all participate</mark> in creating the lyrics.</li>
			<li>Comfort place: As they have been together for <mark>ten years</mark>, they naturally act as a family and also show their <em>comedic</em> side comfortably in their content.</li>
			<li>Talent: Training at a young age helped them with their <mark>synchronization</mark>, as well as their ability to sing through hard choreographies while still having fun on stage.
